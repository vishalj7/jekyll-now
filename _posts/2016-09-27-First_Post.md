This is my first post! 

So I'll give a little description about me and what I do.

I am currently working as an higher apprentice which I started in April 2015. The QA apprenticeship consisted me of taking a course where I had a number of modules that I had to complete in order to achieve my certification. As of 27th September 2016, I am less than a month away from completing my course and achieving my certification. So far during my course, I have learnt a lot of new programming languages such as SQL, Java, Python and a lot of data related topics such as data modelling, business intelligence, creative thinking.
