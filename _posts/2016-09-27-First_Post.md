This is my first post! So I'll give a little description about me and what I do.

I am currently working as an higher apprentice which I started in April 2015 and I am part of the Big Data team which as you've guessed is to do with data on a large scale so I have created this site where I can blog about anything big data related and keep track of what I have learnt. There also will be tutorials and guides about technologies that I have learnt!
