### It's been a while!!!

Hi All, it has been a while since I last posted but I have been busy with the second part of my apprenticeship as I have now stepped on the degree part. 
I started the Software Engineer degree back in September and have been busy every since as I work during the day and then in the evenings I have lectures and pieces of coursework due.

So there are a couple of blog post that have been put on hold since I started Uni such as blogs about Flume, Docker, Java Error handling, Impala and Spark. Some of these are 80% complete and some are half completed. I have other priorities with my Uni work but I will try and complete those blogs mentioned above and release them when I can. 

There are a few mini projects that I want to do as well so look out for blogs about them. Current one I am working on is Road Traffic accidents. 

See you guys soon with a new blog.
